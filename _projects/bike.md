    My first bike is a cross-country bike. I bought it when I was a high school student (Oh more than 10 years alreay).
    I am updating and polishing it from time to time. 
    Currently, it resides on my balcony, a testament to the miles we've traversed together.

    This bicycle is a fixed-gear model. I purchased it upon commencing my college journey. 
    Since I'm unable to locate any photos of the actual bike, I selected a similar one from <a href="https://unsplash.com/@tonchik?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash">Anton Savinov</a>.

    After residing in Australia for a period of two years, I acquired a road bicycle. I embarked on a solo journey with it, traversing from the heart of Melbourne City to the scenic Fort Nepean in Sorrento. Regrettably, on the final day of my studies at the University of Melbourne, the bike was stolen.
