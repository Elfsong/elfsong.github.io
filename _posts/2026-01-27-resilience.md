People with very high expectations have very low resilience.

Unfortunately, resilience matters in success.

I don't know how to teach it to you, except for I hope suffering happens to you.

Greatness is not intelligence.

Greatness comes from character, and character isn't formed out of smart people.

It's formed out of people who suffered.

So that's it.

If I could wish upon you, I don't know how to do it.

I wish upon you ample doses of pain and suffering.
